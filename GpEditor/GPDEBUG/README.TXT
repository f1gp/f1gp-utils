GPDEBUG - A diagnostic tool for GPEDITOR.                   V1.0 24/01/94
-----------------------------------------

If you are having problems with a crash or get a "Packed file corrupt" 
error message then please run GPDEBUG on *both* your modified game EXE
and your pre-modified game EXE. 

For example:

          GPDEBUG GP.EXE

GPDEBUG produces a small output file called GPDEBUG.OP. Please send me
both copies. Make sure you rename the output file *before* running GPDEBUG
a second time.

I suggest you rename the files to ORIGINAL.OP and MODIFIED.OP.

Please also include any information about which car/helmets you modified
(if any).

A ZIP of GPDEBUG.OP packs down to about 1500 bytes.
The ASCII GPDEBUG.OP is about 4000 bytes.
