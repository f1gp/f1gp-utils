Title   : Grand Prix/World Circuit Yellow Flags Patch (IBM)
Keywords: GRAND PRIX WORLD CIRCUIT F1SA F1GP GP WC YELLOW FLAGS

GpFlags (V2.1) patches GP.EXE (USA/European/Italian V1.05) and
modifies the way the game handles yellow flags. Normally yellow flags
are shown after a car has remained stationary for 20s. GpFlags
modifies this so that yellow flags are shown after 1s. GpFlags also
modifies the delay for removing a wrecked car from 15s to 30s. You can
override the default values that GpFlags uses.
