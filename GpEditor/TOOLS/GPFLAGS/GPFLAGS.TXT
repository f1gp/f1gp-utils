GpFlags V2.1 31-Dec-95                           T.Kellaway (CIS:100331,2330)

Grand Prix/World Circuit Yellow Flags Patch.

Introduction
------------
GpFlags patches GP.EXE (USA/English/French/German/Italian V1.05) and modifies
the way the game handles yellow flags.

Normally yellow flags are shown after a car has remained stationary for 20s.
GpFlags modifies this so that yellow flags are shown after 5s.

GpFlags also modifies the time delay for removing a wrecked car from 15s to a
more realistic 30s.

You can override the default values that GpFlags uses.

Installation
------------
Copy GPFLAGS.EXE to the directory where GP.EXE is (e.g. C:\GPRIX).


Usage
-----
Usage: GpFlags {-o | {-p [-fN -cN]}} [-?h] [GP.EXE]
       -o     Restore original code.
       -p     Patch new code (default -f5 -c30).
         -fN  Yellow flags delay (1 to 60).
         -cN  Car removal delay (10 to 60).

To patch the new code use:

     GPFLAGS -p

"Patch Completed OK." will be displayed if OK.

You can remove the patch by using:

     GPFLAGS -o

This restores the original GP.EXE code.

To patch your own values of 3s flags delay and 45s car removal use:

     GPFLAGS -p -f3 -c45

Note: Due to the way the game stores the delays the largest delay possible
is 60s.

Warning: Setting flags delay too low can remove you from the race when pitting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whilst a car is on the track the game uses two timers, one (T1) is the initial
time before the yellow flags are waved, and the second (T2) the amount of time
before the car is removed from the race.

T1 is triggered by the game detecting that the speed of the car has dropped
below 10mph, T1 then expires, the yellow flags come out and T2 is started,
when T2 expires the car is removed from the track. If the car starts to move
above 10mph both T1 and T2 are canceled.

GpFlags allows you to change both the T1 and T2 delay periods.

Unfortunately the game uses T1 when the car is in the pit lane. If you drop
below 10mph whilst in the pit lane (but you aren't stationary in your pit)
then T1 is started, if T1 then expires your car is removed directly from the
race (i.e., it doesn't start T2 before removing you from the race).

It has become common for people to set T1 to 1s and T2 30s. If you drive into
the pits slowly it is possible for your speed to drop below 10mph for longer
than the T1 period and you will be removed from the race, this is especially
true of those people using auto-brakes (F2).

There isn't an easy modification to the patch to stop this happening so all I
can suggest is that people increase the value of T1 to a suitable value (3s?
5s?) where this situation won't arise. As people should now be aware what
causes this they will at least know they should try and avoid dropping below
10mph for too long whilst in the pit lane.

The default value has been increased to 5s but you can still set it back down
to 1s if you haven't experienced this problen.
