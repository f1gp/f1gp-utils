SetNames V1.0 30/Jul/94 - Set Grand Prix names for a saved game.
Copyright (c) T.Kellaway (CIS:100331,2330) 1994 - All Rights Reserved.

Usage: SetNames (name file) (saved game)

SetNames takes an MPS style name file (*.NAM) and uses this to update the
specified saved game file (normally a *.SAV or *.RPL).

The driver's and team names are normally stored in the saved game file.
This means that if you start a championship season you can't modify the
names again. This program allows you to modify the names by updating the
saved game file with names from a standard name file.

To change the names in the middle of a season start GP, load you saved
game. Now abort the season. Edit the names file as required. Save the
new names file. Now run SetNames. 

For example, assume you have SEASON.NAM and SEASON.SAV:

     SETNAMES SEASON.NAM SEASON.SAV.

Make sure you have a backup of the saved game just in case something
goes horribly wrong.
