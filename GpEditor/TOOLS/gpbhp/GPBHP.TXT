           Modify BHP and AIG for Grand Prix/World Circuit
           ===============================================


Introduction
------------
GpBHP patches GP.EXE (USA/English/French/German/Italian V1.05) and modifies
the player's BHP (engine power) and the CC (computer car's) AIG (grip) level.

The player's car performance can be changed from a low of 450 to a high of
999 BHP (the game's default value is 716BHP).

The CC AIG can be changed from 1 to 100 (the game's default value is 1).
Increasing the AIG increase the CC grip levels, this causes them to brake
later and increases the cornering speed. Beware that if you set the AIG too
high for 100% race distances then the CC will wear out their tyres. See the
CCPIT utility to remove this problem.


Installation
------------
Copy GPBHP.EXE to the directory where GP.EXE is (e.g. C:\GPRIX).


Usage
-----
Usage: GpBHP [-?Ýh] [-aN] [-bN] [GP.EXE]

To modify the values to BHP 800 and AIG 12 use:
