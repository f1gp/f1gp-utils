GPEFXDTA.EXE     V1.0 11/02/94

This program patches an F1ED.DTA file to ensure that it will coexist with
GPEDITOR V1.x.

To use it:

     1)   Use F1ED to set any parameters desired.
     2)   Perform a 'W' to update GP.EXE and write the F1ED.DTA.
     3)   Now run 'GPEFXDTA.EXE' to patch the F1ED.DTA.
     4)   Now run F1ED again and do another 'W' to update GP.EXE.
     5)   GPEDITOR V1.x should now work on your GP.EXE!


Note: 
Users of US V1.04 or V1.05 GP.EXE should ensure that they have upgraded
GPEDITOR to V1.1 via the GPEFX1.ZIP patch (available in CIS SPRTSIMS
Lib #6 MotorSports).
