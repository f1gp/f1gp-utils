GpWet V1.1 17-Dec-95                             T.Kellaway (CIS:100331,2330)

Grand Prix/World Circuit Wet Race Probability Patch.

Introduction
------------
GpWet patches GP.EXE (USA/English/French/German/Italian V1.05) and modifies
the probability of a wet race.

Normally there is a 6.25% chance of a wet race. Using GpWet you can set the
probability anywhere from always wet (100%) to always dry (0%).

Note that GpWet changes the probability of a normal non-championship or
championship season race, it doesn't modify a quick race (as there is
an option in the quick race menu for selecting a wet/dry race).

Installation
------------
Copy GPWET.EXE to the directory where GP.EXE is (e.g. C:\GPRIX).


Usage
-----
GpWet {-o | -p} [-?h] [GP.EXE]
       -o     Restore original probability (6.25%).
       -p     Patch new probability (0 - 100).
       -h?    This usage message.

To patch a 100% probability of a wet race:

     GPWET -p100

To patch a 0% probability of a wet race (always dry):

     GPWET -p0

To restore the game default:

     GPWET -o

This restores the original GP.EXE code. Note that the actual default is
6.25% percent so use -o (not -p6) to restore the default.

To determine the current value don't specify any options:

     GPWET

The current wet race probability will be displayed.
