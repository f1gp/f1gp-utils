Here is a work around for GPEDITOR V1.x not recognising GP.EXE after an
F1ED patch has been performed.

The enclosed batch file patches the F1ED.DTA file and restores some fixed
bytes that F1ED has modifed. The DOS DEBUG.EXE must be in your path.

To use it:

     1)   Use F1ED to set any parameters desired.
     2)   Perform a 'W' to update GP.EXE and write the F1ED.DTA.
     3)   Now run 'DTAV13.BAT' to patch the F1ED.DTA.
     4)   Now run F1ED again and do another 'W' to update GP.EXE.
     5)   GPEDITOR should now work on your GP.EXE!
