LINKRPL.EXE takes an MPS GP *linked* replay file and converts it to a
replay viewable on a non-linked (i.e. standalone) machine.

Note that only the players' car on which the replay was saved will be
correctly displayed; the other machines player's car will carry on
driving at the same speed in the same direction and will probably crash.

This means that this program is only suitable for displaying replays
where one of the two driver's cars are involved; i.e., you *can't* use
it to display incidents involving both cars :-(

This is because the game obtains the information about the other linked
player's car from the other linked machine's replay file. It might be
possible with further work to write software which would combine the two
replay files but this will probably involve a fair amount of work.

To use LINKRPL *copy* the replay file you wish to modify, then run:

     LINKRPL FILENAME.RPL

Note that the modified file will *only* be viewable on a single machine
now. So backup the file if you ever want to view it in linked mode!
