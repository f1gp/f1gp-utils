QTYRES V1.1 23-Jun-95                           T.Kellaway (CIS:100331,2330)

Grand Prix/World Circuit Qualifying Tyres Patch.

Introduction
------------
QTYRES patches GP.EXE (USA/English/French/German/Italian V1.05) and modifies
the way the game handles qualifying tyres (Q's). 

Normally Q's can only be used in a qualifying session. QTYRES permits
Q's to be used in any type of session (except a race). 

The main reason for writing QTYRES was to permit Q's to be used in a
PRACTICE session (where you were previously restricted to D's).

QTYRES also removes the 4 set limit on Q's in a qualifying session (it
is now 64). Note that the AI cars can use more than 4 sets as well in
a 120min qualifying session, but in practice I've never seen this.


Installation
------------
Copy QTYRES.EXE to the directory where GP.EXE is (e.g. C:\GPRIX).


Usage
-----
Usage: Qtyres {-o | -p} [GP.EXE]
       -o   Restore Original code.
       -p   Patch new qualifying code.

To patch the new code use:

     QTYRES -p

"Patch Completed OK. Q-tyres now enabled." will be displayed if OK.
If GP.EXE has already been patched before then "Qtyres: Patched already!"
will be displayed.

You can remove the patch by using:

     QTYRES -o

This restores the original GP.EXE code.
