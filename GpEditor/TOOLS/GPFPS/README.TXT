GpFPS allows you to modify the saved frame rate (FPS). This is useful when
exchanging saved games between several people who use different FPS settings
due to their machine's capabilties.


Usage: GpFPS (saved game) [FPS]

Available FPS:
25.0, 23.0, 21.4, 20.0, 18.7, 17.6, 16.6, 15.7, 15.0, 14.2, 13.6, 13.0, 12.5

If you don't specify an FPS just the current setting will be displayed.

will be used.

Make sure you have a backup of the saved game just in case something
goes horribly wrong.
