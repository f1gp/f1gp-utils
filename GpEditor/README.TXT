GP Editor                                              V4.1 23rd June 1994
---------

GPEDITOR is a Windows utility for editing the car and helmet designs
(colours) used by the MicroProseTM PC "Grand Prix" / "World Circuit"
simulation program. GPEDITOR may also be used to modify the performance of
the cars and drivers.

GPEDITOR requires Windows V3.1 and a mouse. For best results this program
requires a Windows display driver capable of displaying 256 or more
simultaneous colours. It will however work with standard 16 colour display
drivers, but the colours won't correspond very well to those seen whilst
running the game.

GPEDITOR has been tested with the following versions of GP.EXE:

     V1.03/V1.05    European (English/French/German)
     V1.04/V1.05    USA
     V1.05          Italian

As this is not a MicroProse product you should not attempt to get support for
a modified game EXE file from MicroProse.If you have problems with the game
then install the original copy of the game EXE.

Note: If you use GPLAPTIM you *must* use V4.0 or later (of GPLAPTIM) to be
      compatible with this version of GPEDITOR.
