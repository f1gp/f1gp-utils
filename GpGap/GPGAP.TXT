                 Grand Prix/World Circuit Gap Display
                 ====================================

GpGap improves the 'G' gap command for MPS Grand Prix/World Circuit from
just displaying who is in-front/behind you to showing the other cars,
the lap the leader is on and the gap back from the leader to each car.

GpGap requires V1.05 (European/USA/Italian) of Grand Prix/World Circuit.

File List
---------
     GPGAP.EXE      The TSR which should be loaded before F1GP.
     GPGAP.TXT      This help file, but you know that <g>.

Installation
------------
Copy GPGAP.EXE to any directory on your hard disk. The directory where you
have F1GP installed is probably the best place (normally C:\GPRIX).

Loading GPGAP
-------------
GpGap is a TSR utility and should be loaded before F1GP. GpGap takes 2Kb of
memory, it may be loaded high if you don't have enough memory to run F1GP.

     Usage: GpGap [-h?] [-dN] [-tN] [-u]
            -dN       Delay N seconds between display (default 3s).
            -tN       Display top N places (default 6).
            -h,-?     This help message.
            -u        Unload TSR.


How to use GPGAP and its non-obvious features
---------------------------------------------
GpGap extends the existing 'G' command in the game (this includes the
automatic invocation of the 'G' command that is performed when you pass the
start/finish line in a race). Initially you may find is hard to take in this
information and still stay on the track! <g>. However with careful
configuration of GpGap's parameters and selected glances you will quickly find
you can keep track of the rest of the field during a race.

GpGap allows the standard in-front/behind gap display to operate as normal
for 5s. It will then restore the top part of your display so you can see your
speed and will display the leader. The leader's lap number is displayed on the
left of their name and the current race postion is displayed on the right.

GpGap will also show you the time gap behind the leader for each car (to the
left of the driver's name). Note that GpGap can only display this gap when
the race positions have remained static for a lap. GpGap will display as many
of the time gaps back from the leader as is possible. At the start of the
race you won't see these gaps very often but as the race settles down they
will appear most of the time. Even if a car is a lap or more behind the
leader the gap will always be shown as a time (as opposed to the game just
showing you "1 Lap").

You can configure the number of the positions displayed by GpGap and the
length of time each is held for. By default the top six cars are shown with a
delay of 3s for each car. For example to display the entire field, pausing for
2s use:

     GPGAP -t26 -d3

There is a tradeoff between the number of positions displayed and the hold
time for each. Don't forget that the time to display all the positions should
be less than the lap time. Also the hold time needs to be long enough so you
can concentrate on your driving but still glance down at the positions.

A good compromise is the top ten positions with a hold time of three seconds.
This will give a total of 30s plus the initial 5s, this gives you ample time
to trigger a display of the field at a more appropriate part of the track for
easy viewing.

You can invoke GpGap at anytime with the 'G' key, but if you cross the
start/finish line then the game will cancel the current display. Note that
your cockpit display maybe slightly confused for a bit, this is down to an
existing bug in the game cockpit update routines.

You can also cancel the current GpGap display at anytime by pressing the 'G'
key whilst the gaps are being displayed. The game will redisplay the
in-front/behind gap once and then revert to the normal display mode.

You can also restart the gap display at anytime by pressing the 'G' key
twice. This is useful if you are too busy driving the first part of a lap to
look, but can then restart the display when you get to a part of the track
where it is easier to view the information displayed.

GpGap takes a snapshot of the field when you press the 'G' key so if you are
displaying the whole field the information could well be out of date by the
time it is displayed. (This includes the current lap the leader is on.)

Due to a limit in the existing game display routines the leader's current lap
number only goes up to lap 63. Anything above this value is not shown. If a
car is more than 10mins behind the leader the gap time won't be displayed.


Unloading GPGAP
---------------
When you have finished using GPGAP you can unload it to reclaim the memory
(~2Kb) that it uses. Type:

     GPGAP -u

Note that if you have loaded other TSRs after GPGAP you must unload these
in the reverse order they were loaded.

--------
You may find GPBUTTON useful as this allows you to map a joystick/wheel
button to a keyboard key, the 'G' for the gap display being a favourite!
