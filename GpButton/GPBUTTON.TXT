      Grand Prix/World Circuit Joystick Button to Key Converter
      =========================================================

Have you ever wished you could use those spare buttons on your joystick or
wheel to emulate a keyboard command? Well now you can, no more stretching
to the keyboard whilst driving and crashing <g>.

GpButton allows you define any of the four possible joystick buttons to
simulate pressing a key on the keyboard. GpButton requires V1.05 of
Grand Prix/World Circuit.

File List
---------
     GPBUTTON.EXE   The TSR which should be loaded before F1GP.
     GPBUTTON.TXT   This help file, but you know that <g>.

Installation
------------
Copy GPBUTTON.EXE to any directory on your hard disk. The directory where you
have F1GP installed is probably the best place (normally C:\GPRIX).

Loading GPBUTTON
----------------
GpButton is a TSR utility and should be loaded before F1GP. GpButton takes
2Kb of memory, it may be loaded high if you don't have enough memory to
run F1GP.

     Usage: GpButton [-A1='?'] [-A2='?'] [-B1='?'] [-B2='?'] [-h?] [-u]
            -A1='?'   Joystick A Button 1=?.
            -A2='?'   Joystick A Button 2=?.
            -B1='?'   Joystick B Button 1=?.
            -B2='?'   Joystick B Button 2=?.
            -h,-?     This help message.
            -u        Unload TSR.

     '?' may be one of:
            1234567890 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
            F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 Ent

For eaxmple, to configure joystick B button 1 to simulate the 'G' (Gap)
function and joystick B button 2 to the Pause function (' ' or 'P' depending
on configuration) use:

     GPBUTTON -B1='g' -B2='p'

The joystick buttons you use with GpButton must not be already in use by the
game. GpButton simulates key presses when the joystick is currently enabled,
this means that if you crash out of the race the buttons will stop working
whilst you are watching the other cars (note this may also be true in some
of the menus).

Non-Standard Keyboards
----------------------
Due to the way GpButton works it has to map the actual "scan code" of the
keyboard key to the desired letter. The PC assigns a unique "scan code"
number to every key on the keyboard and these are the same for all keyboards.
However, for different nationality keyboards (notably French and German) the
mapping from the standard QWERTY layout to QWERTZ and AZERTY is performed in
software. GpButton assumes you have a standard QWERTY keyboard. If you have a
non-standard key layout then just work out where the key you require would be
on a standard keyboard and GpButton should work fine.

Unloading GPBUTTON
------------------
When you have finished using GPBUTTON you can unload it to reclaim the memory
(~2Kb) that it uses. Type:

     GPBUTTON -u

Note that if you have loaded other TSRs after GPBUTTON you must unload these
in the reverse order they were loaded. 

Change History
--------------
V1.0 07-May-95      First release.
V1.1 12-May-95      Added support for <Enter> key.
