The lap time authenticator checks the authentication records produced
by the GPLAPTIM TSR (in binary) and exported to ASCII text by either
GPLAP or GPLAPW.

     Usage: AUTHLAP (filename) [filename] [...]

Multiple filenames may be specified, wildcards (e.g., *.TXT) may also
be used.

AUTHLAP will read any ASCII text file and automatically detects the
special authentication strings (AUTH1: and AUTH2:). Thus to check a
submitted time just save the forum message as a file and then run
AUTHLAP on it.

E.g. for a saved file LAP.TXT which contains:

     Subj:  F1SA Hot-Lap             Racing Circuits
       To:  Paul D'Ascensio          76040,33
     From:  Trevor Kellaway [UK]     100331,2330

     Silverstone, Great Britain
     1:18.309 Trevor Kellaway BHP:716 AIG:4 Ace,S,T 9-Oct-95 10:19pm
     AUTH1:[0372E5310100CC0204C004191316090ACB0754726576]
     AUTH2:[6F72204B656C6C617761790000000000000000002286]

Then "AUTHLAP LAP.TXT" will produce:

     AuthLap V6.1 4th Apr 96
     Silverstone - Great Britain  9-Oct-95 22:19:25 - Qualifying
     1:18.309 Trevor Kellaway BHP:716 AIG:4 Ace,S,T
     Authentication code OK

All of the information displayed by AUTHLAP is recovered from the AUTH1:
and AUTH2: fields, thus you should use the time displayed by AUTHLAP not
the one displayed in the original message (as the user could have edited
this one and it's there only so others can see the details of the lap).

If the authentication code is incorrect then "Authentication code FAILED!"
will be displayed after the entry.

V4.1 and later of GPLAPTIM support checking of a number of illegal game
settings. If either any of these are detected then following is displayed:

     Authentication code OK, but:
          Illegal Wings
          Illegal Tyres
          Game Save/Reload or Pause >30s.
          Game Save/Reload or Pause >10s.
          Illegal BHP (reloaded save game with illegal BHP).
          Illegal use of Grass.
          Illegal Damage Limits.

If a version of GPLAPTIM prior to V4.1 was used then the following is
displayed:

  "Authentication code OK (old style record, no checks for illegal wings/tyres)"

Or if prior to V5.0 then:

  "Authentication code OK (V4.1 record, only checks for illegal wings/tyres)"

Or if prior to V6.0 then:

  "Authentication code OK (V5.0 record, no checks for illegal damage)"

V6.0 of GPLAPTIM adds detection of non-standard damage limit values. This
version also adds a new elapsed race time authentication record which is
logged at 50% and 100% of a full race distance, this is to aid authentication
of race results.

V6.1 is functionally the same as V6.0, the version number has just been
increased to keep in step with GpLapTim.

Note that the user may try and fool you by supplying a valid authentication
record *but* editing the plaintext time in the original message. You should
ensure that the time displayed by AUTHLAP is the *same* as the one in the
original positing. Even better, when compiling the hot laps charts use the
output of AUTHLAP instead of the submitted plaintext times.

Multiple authentication entries may be present in a single file, thus a
player can submit more than one time per forum message. Free form ASCII
text may be mixed between entries so hopefully you will only have to save
the message and run AUTHLAP on it to check the details.
