                     What's New in GPLAPTIM V7.0
                     ===========================
GPLAPTIM.COM
------------
Improvements for hotseat mode:

1. Set player grip to 1 only if it is the active player (not computer
   controlled). CC player will use the regular AIG value instead.

2. When car control goes to automatic (CC player) or to control (player),
   the grip will be set accordingly.

3. The CC player BHP can be set from the commandline using option -w,
   e.g. to set it to 800 BHP:

   GPLAPTIM -w800

   Default value is 716. The range is 1 to 1460 BHP.
   Randomization of this value will be disabled, just like for player BHP.

4. The BHP logged in the authentication record and shown by GPLap will be
   the value for either CC player or player, whoever is in control at the
   time the car passes the s/f line.

GPLAP.EXE
---------
1. Added watch period parameter. Defaults to 0 seconds. This used to be
   hardcoded at 5 seconds. It might have been necessary for Windows 3,
   but it's not necessary for DOSBox.


Thanks to Hrvoje Stimac for suggestions and testing.
