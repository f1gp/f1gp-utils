              Grand Prix/World Circuit Car Performance
              ========================================

GPPERF is a new engine management unit (EMU) for the MPS F1 Grand Prix
(World Circuit) simulator (US & European V1.05).

The EMU contains a black box data recorder which can record (to disk) the
speed, RPM and gear (& more) every ~16ft (~5m) of the track. Current F1 style
RPM warning LEDs are also included, along with a tyre wear indication bar.

Due to the large amounts of data being logged (~30Kb per lap) and the high
speed it is being logged at (~12 per second) you should setup a RAM disk for
the log file.

Please read the rest of this file as it will probably answer some of
questions you didn't even know you wanted to ask!

Installation
------------
Copy GPPERF.EXE to any directory on your hard disk. The directory where you
have F1GP installed is probably the best place (normally C:\GPRIX).


Installing and Using a RAM disk
-------------------------------
DOS 5 and DOS 6 come with a RAM disk driver called RAMDRIVE.SYS.  This is an
installable device driver that lets you use a portion of your extended memory
as if it were a hard disk. Note that the contents of the RAM disk will be
lost when you reboot (power down) your machine, therefore you must copy any
data you wish to keep from the RAM disk to your hard disk before shutting the
machine down.

The main advantage of using a RAM disk is that it is very fast to access as
it is purely solid state memory with no slow moving mechanical parts like a
real hard disk.

To install the RAM disk you need to add the following line(s) to your
C:\CONFIG.SYS:

     DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
     DEVICE=C:\DOS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 512 /e

If you don't have a C:\DOS directory modify the pathname to point to the DOS
directory where RAMDRIVE.SYS is located. If you already have HIMEM.SYS
present then add the RAMDRIVE.SYS line after the HIMEM.SYS line. When editing
your CONFIG.SYS always make sure you have a boot floppy available just in
case the machine won't boot. You can create a boot floppy with the following
command (assuming your floppy drive is A:):

     FORMAT A: /S

The second parameter to RAMDRIVE.SYS (512) is the number of Kb of memory
allocated to the RAM disk. If you only have 1Mb of memory you will have to
decrease this to 300Kb or less. If you have >1Mb you will be able to increase
it (I have 8Mb of RAM and use a 2Mb RAM disk by specifying 2000). Roughly
14Kb is logged per lap (this varies depending on the circuit length) and
512Kb will allow storage of about 36 timed laps of data.

The RAMDRIVE.SYS "/e" switch tells DOS to allocate the RAM disk memory from
your extended memory, as 600,000 bytes of the low DOS memory must be
available for F1GP to run.

After editing your CONFIG.SYS you must reboot your machine for the driver to
create the RAM disk. When the machine reboots check that the driver installs
OK and the drive letter that has been created for it. Normally the next free
drive letter will be assigned, so if you only have one logical drive C: the
RAM disk will install as D:. Note that if you have one logical drive (C:) and
a CD-ROM (normally D:) then the RAM disk will be installed as D: and the
CD-ROM will be moved to E:.


Out of RAM Disk Space
---------------------
If the RAM disk fills up whilst logging the machine will beep and logging
mode will be disabled. If you are running under a multi-tasker like Windows
you can't just delete the log file from the RAM disk, you must also exit and
restart F1GP to re-enable logging (you don't need to unload/reload GPPERF,
just restart F1GP).


Loading GPPERF
--------------
By default GPPERF.EXE will create its log file (called GPPERF.PRF) in the
current directory where you load GPPERF.EXE. As you must ensure that the log
file is placed on your RAM disk use the "-f" switch to specify the log file
location and filename. E.g., if your RAM disk is D: then use:

     GPPERF -fD:\GPPERF.PRF

Alternatively move to the RAM disk and load GPPERF (you may need to specify
the full path to GPPERF.EXE if it isn't in your PATH):

     D:
     C:\GPRIX\GPPERF

GPPERF will use the default log filename of GPPERF.PRF in the default
directory, which is currently D: the RAM disk.

If you only just have the 600,000 bytes of low DOS memory available that F1GP
requires then you may need to load GPPERF into high memory (GPPERF uses ~3Kb
of memory). To load it high you must have Upper Memory Blocks available
(UMBs). DOS includes a memory manager called EMM386 which will provide UMBs
(on 386/486/Pentium machines only, not 286s). Third party memory managers
are also available that provide UMBs, e.g., QEMM and 386MAX. Depending on the
memory manager you are using you need to use either the LH or LOADHIGH
command in front of GPPERF at the DOS command prompt. E.g.,

     LH GPPERF -fD:\GPPERF.PRF

You may also change some of the other defaults of GPPERF when you load it.

     Usage: GpPerf [-lN] [-aN -bN -cN] [-h?] [-u] [-f(filename)]
            -l(N)     Auto-log for N laps (default 1 lap).
            -f(name)  Specify log filename's location.
            -a(N)     Specify rev limit #1 (default 10000).
            -b(N)     Specify rev limit #2 (default 11500).
            -c(N)     Specify rev limit #3 (default 13000).
            -d        Startup with logging disabled.
            -e        Startup with logging enabled.
            -t        Startup with tyre wear display disabled.
            -n(N)     Log for computer car N only.
            -h,-?     This help message.
            -u        Unload TSR.

These other options are described in more detail below.


Unloading GPPERF
----------------
When you have finished using GPPERF you can unload it to reclaim the memory
(~3Kb) that it uses. Type:

     GPPERF -u

Note that if you have loaded other TSRs after GPPERF you must unload these in
the reverse order they were loaded.


Co-existing with SPLITTIM
-------------------------
If you are using SPLITTIM.EXE (V2.0 or earlier) then you must load it *after*
loading GPPERF for both programs to co-exist. If you load them the wrong way
around SPLITTIM will still work but GPPERF won't do anything (you can tell
this as the top left LED in your car's cockpit is yellow by default when
GPPERF is running). Note that SPLITTIM is now obsolete as GPLAP V5.0 now
incorporates its functionality.


Changes to your F1GP Cockpit
----------------------------
The main change to your car's cockpit is the bank of 5 LEDs to the left of
your steering wheel (in this description these are referred to from bottom to
top, #1 to #5). Several new keyboard commands have also been added (<F7>,
<F8>, <F9>, <F10>).

Previously the game used these 5 LEDs to indicate the current difficulty
level (opposition standard). Use the menu option "OPTIONS/GAME" to
check/change this.

The top LED (#5) now indicates the state of your EMU. The LED changes colours
depending on the current mode of the EMU.

The bottom 3 LEDs are used as an engine RPM warning (like most real F1 cars
now use). By default LED #1 will light when you reach 10000 RPM, LED #2 at
11500 RPM and LED #3 at 13000 RPM. The first two LEDs will turn yellow when
on, the third LED will turn red.

LED #4 isn't used.

The new <F7> and <F8> keys control the logging mode, see below for more
details.

The <F9> key toggles the MPH (KM/H) display between its normal speed display
and the current track segment count. Each circuit is divided up into ~16ft
(~5m) segments. This mode allows you to determine exactly which point on a
circuit corresponds to a logged data entry. Note that due to the display
limit of 3 digits at some tracks which have more than 999 segments the
displayed segment number will wrap back to 000, even though it is really
1000+.

The <F10> key toggles the tyre wear display bar on/off. This bar appears
just below the speed readout.


Changing RPM Limits
-------------------
You can customise the RPM limit points by specifying your own values when you
load GPPERF.EXE. To change to 9000, 11000, 13000 use:

     GPPERF -fD:\GPPERF.PRF -a9000 -b11000 -c13000

You must specify the RPM values in increasing order. If you don't want the
RPM warning LEDs then set them all to a high value, e.g.,

     GPPERF -fD:\GPPERF.PRF -a14000 -b14000 -c14000


Manual Logging Mode (Blue LED)
------------------------------
The <F7> key toggles between logging mode off (Green LED) and manual logging
mode on (Blue LED). In manual logging mode data is logged all the time, even
when you are travelling into/out of the pit lane and on warmup and slow down
laps. To reduce the amount of unwanted data logged use the automatic logging
mode. Note that when you are in the pit lane entries are logged with a
segment value of greater than 2000.


Automatic Logging Mode (Red/Yellow LED)
---------------------------------------
The <F8> key toggles between logging mode off (Green LED) and automatic
logging mode (Yellow/Red LED). Automatic mode intelligently enables/disables
logging on-the-fly as you cross the start/finish line.

When the LED is yellow automatic logging mode is enabled but it is waiting
for you to start a flying lap. When you cross the start/finish line for the
first time the LED changes to red indicating that logging is now is progress.
When you complete your flying lap logging mode will return to its pending
mode indicated by the yellow LED.

You can customise the number of flying laps that logging stays enabled for
using the "-l" command line option. E.g., if you normally do 3 timed
qualifying laps (1 out lap, 3 timed laps and 1 slow down lap) then use:

     GPPERF -fD:\GPPERF.PRF -l3

GPPERF will now leave logging enabled for three timed laps then return to its
pending mode. Note that the games annoying behaviour of requesting you to pit
after one timed lap is also modified, you won't be called into the pit until
logging mode returns to pending mode (the computer cars will still only do a
single timed lap).

GPPERF copes with replays and returning early to the pit (either via the pit
lane or using the 'Q' key). If you return to the pit lane logging mode
returns to pending automatically. Viewing replays of crossing the
start/finish line will not affect the current logging mode.

Note that logging during a race is handled slightly differently, in a race
automatic logging will never be automatically disabled when you enter the
pits and the '-l' lap countdown will be ignored. The automatic enable feature
will still work when you cross the start/finish line for the first time.

No Logging Mode (Green LED)
---------------------------
If you don't wish logging mode to be enabled toggle either <F7> or <F8> until
the LED turns to green. No data will ever be logged while this mode is
selected. You can also use the '-d' command line option to force logging mode
to be disabled at startup (rather than enabled/pending which is the default).

Logging a Computer Car
----------------------
You may also log just a computer car. Specify the computer car number with the
-n option. E.g., to log car number 5 use:

     GPPERF -n5

Note to change the car number logged or disable it you will need to unload
GPPERF and reload it (use GPPERF -u).


Tyre Wear Indication
--------------------
The cockpit now also includes a horizontal tyre wear indication bar just
below the speed readout. When you first drive out of the pits a red indicator
bar will appear, the bars size will gradually decrease to zero as the tyres
come up to full working temperature (and hence maximum grip). At some circuits
you will get extra grip which will be indicated by a yellow bar. When the
tyres reach the optimal level the indicator bar will remains static, once the
tyres start to wear out then the grip will drop and the indicator bar will
drop back from yellow to an increasing red bar. Note that at different tracks
you will get a different maximum grip level displayed (the size of the yellow
bar), and at some tracks (like Canada) the yellow bar is never displayed.
You can toggle the tyre wear indiciation on/off using the <F10> key.


Viewing Log Files
------------------
OK, you've now got a large GPPERF.PRF file, how do you view it?  At present
this package only includes SHOWPERF a DOS command line program for displaying
the data in a human readable form, or in CSV (comma separated value) form for
spreadsheet programs.

A Windows program to view PRF files called GPA.ZIP (V4.0 or later) written
by Steve Pritchard CIS:[100341,2464] is available on Compuserve in the
SPRTSIMS area (GO SPRTSIMS, in library #6 Motorsports or #14 Racing
Circuits).

SHOWPERF Viewer
---------------
SHOWPERF is a DOS command line program used to view/filter *.PRF files.

     Usage: ShowPerf [-fwcxk] [-itsrgdab] [-h?] [log filename]
            -?/-h  This usage message.

            -f     Write fastest lap to '?m??s???.PRF' file.
            -w     Write all laps to '?m??s???.PRF' files.

            -c     Display in CSV export format.
            -x     Scale RPM & Gears to match speed scale (for CSV export).
            -k     Display speed in KPH.

     Filter options (all on by default)
            -i     Identity of track segment.
            -t     Time (elapsed time of session).
            -s     Speed in MPH (or KPH).
            -r     RPM.
            -g     Gear.
            -d     Direction (steering).
            -a     Accelerator.
            -b     Brake.

By default SHOWPERF will try and open GPPERF.PRF in the current directory and
display all entries in a human readable form.


Exporting CSV Files
-------------------
Use the '-c' option to obtain an output file in CSV format suitable for
import into a spreadsheet. E.g.,

     SHOWPERF -c GPPERF.PRF > GPPERF.CSV

When using a spreadsheet to graph a CSV you may find it useful to use the
'-x' option to scale the Speed/RPM/Gears so they all use the same Y-axis.
E.g.,:

     SHOWPERF -c -x GPPERF.PRF > GPPERF.CSV

To obtain only the speed and RPM data for graphing use the filter options,
e.g.,:

     SHOWPERF -c -x -s -r GPPERF.PRF > GPPERF.CSV

The displayed data can be filtered to only include the specified items, by
default all data is included.


Filtering Log Files
-------------------
You can use SHOWPERF to filter a large GPPERF.PRF file. To obtain just the
fastest lap from a GPPERF.PRF file use:

     SHOWPERF -f GPPERF.PRF

This will create a file with a filename based on the fastest lap, e.g., if
the fastest lap was 1m10.386 then a file called 1M10S386.PRF will be created.

You can view these ?M??S???.PRF using SHOWPERF in exactly the same way as a
large GPPERF.PRF file.

If you wish to break a complete GPPERF.PRF file into individual laps then use
the '-w' option. This will create a file for every time. Note that if there
are duplicate times then the previous file for that specific time will be
overwritten by the duplicate lap time data.
