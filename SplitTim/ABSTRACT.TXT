Title   : Split Section Timer for MPS Grand Prix (IBM)
Keywords: SPLIT SECTION TIMER TSR RACING FREEWARE F1GP WC IBM WORLD CIRCUIT

SPLITTIM is a small TSR which modifies the behaviour of GP.EXE. It
adds split section times to all GP circuits. Each circuit is divided
into four sections, as you pass each section the display on your
car's dash will show you your split (intermediate) time. The split
time is held on the display then the timer will return to its normal
mode of counting.
